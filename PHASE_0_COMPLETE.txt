Phase 0: Database Architecture Consolidation - COMPLETE ✅
Date: 2025-11-02

WHAT CHANGED:
- Single authoritative database: elohimos_app.db
- Auto-running migrations on startup (non-interactive)
- Admin dashboard shows real metrics only (no phantom data)
- All services use auth_service.db_path (points to app_db)
- Backups limited to authoritative DBs only

VERIFIED:
✅ Admin dashboard: 2 real users (not 29 phantom)
✅ User profile API: Correctly joins user_profiles ↔ users
✅ Migration: 2 users + 4 sessions migrated from legacy auth.db
✅ Founder login: Works correctly with env variables

LEGACY DATABASES (safe to delete after backup):
- .neutron_data/auth.db (replaced by elohimos_app.db)
- .neutron_data/users.db (replaced by user_profiles in app_db)

FILES MODIFIED:
✓ config_paths.py - Auto-detect project root
✓ migrations/phase0_user_db.py - Migration logic
✓ startup_migrations.py - Migration runner
✓ user_service.py - Uses user_profiles in app_db
✓ admin_service.py - Real metrics only
✓ permissions.py - Reads roles from app_db
✓ backup_service.py - Authoritative DBs only
✓ main.py - Integrated startup migrations

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/dev/PHASE_0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- docs/dev/SECURITY_AND_PERMISSIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md (updated)

Ready to commit!
