## Our Values

ElohimOS is built on the conviction that:

### 1. **All People Are Made in the Image of God**
Every person has inherent worth and dignity. We honor that in how we treat each other.

### 2. **Jesus' Love is Radically Inclusive**
Jesus didn't turn anyone away. Neither do we. Our community welcomes everyone—especially those religion has rejected.

### 3. **Excellence Honors the Creator**
We strive for excellence in our work and our conduct because both reflect on the One we serve.

### 4. **Grace Over Legalism**
We lead with grace, not judgment. Everyone is on a journey; we support each other along the way.

### 5. **Technology Should Serve, Not Divide**
Our mission is to build tools that heal and empower, not dominate or exclude.

## A Note on Faith & Inclusion

**ElohimOS is a faith-driven project**, but that does not mean:
- Only Christians are welcome (people of all faiths and no faith are welcome)
- We enforce theological conformity (we celebrate diverse perspectives)
- We use faith as a weapon (we lead with love, not judgment)

What it **does** mean:
- Our **values** are rooted in Jesus' radical love and inclusion
- Our **mission** is to serve the vulnerable and marginalized
- Our **conduct** is guided by grace, humility, and service

If you've been hurt by religion, you're **especially** welcome here.
