# Founder Statement — Josh, Founder of MagnetarAI

## Who I Am

My name is Josh. I'm a technologist, veteran, and follower of Jesus.
I grew up as the only child of a Southern Baptist pastor. For years, I wrestled with feeling "different," not realizing that I was gay and didn't have a language—or a safe place—to name it. I carried shame, confusion, and a constant sense of exile. I ran from God, chasing satisfaction in everything the world offered, but it always left me empty.

Everything changed in May 2025 in a hotel room in London.
Alone, exhausted, and hollow, I broke down and cried out, "God, I need You."
And He met me there. That moment became the beginning of my real life.

## Why I Built MagnetarAI

God gave me a systems-engineering mind—an ADHD-fueled gift to see patterns in chaos. After years in tech, I realized He wasn't just preparing me for a job; He was preparing me for a mission.

**MagnetarAI** was born from that calling: to build technology that reflects the Creator.
Where others see code, I see creation—order pulled from chaos, light pulled from darkness.

**ElohimOS** is the core: a local, secure AI operating system that empowers missions, ministries, and communities to do more with less.
**MagnetarMission** is the outreach: the hands and feet of Jesus serving the poor, the outcast, and the forgotten.

## Why It Matters

The Church has hurt people. I know because I was one of them.
But Jesus never turned anyone away. His arms stretched wide on the cross were open to everyone—and that's what this work is about.

MagnetarAI exists to bring that message of love, redemption, and practical empowerment to the world—through technology that serves, not dominates; that heals, not divides.

## My Conviction

Jesus didn't die to create a social club. He died to create a movement of love—fierce, radical, inclusive love.
If I die tomorrow, I want the Lord to say,
**"Well done, my good and faithful servant."**

That's the purpose behind MagnetarAI.
