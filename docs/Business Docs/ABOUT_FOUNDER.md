# About Josh – Founder of MagnetarAI

Josh is a technologist, veteran, and believer whose life changed when grace met him in the middle of his brokenness.

The son of a Southern Baptist pastor, he spent years running from God and from himself—until, in a London hotel room in 2025, he cried out to God and found the peace he had been chasing.

With a background in logistics and AI systems at Amazon, Josh founded **MagnetarAI** to merge technology and ministry—building offline, secure tools that empower missions and restore dignity.

Through **ElohimOS**, the core platform, and **MagnetarMission**, the outreach arm, he leads a movement to love the people religion has too often rejected.

His mission is simple: *Use technology to love people and glorify God.*

## LinkedIn About Section

I'm Josh — a technologist, veteran, and founder of **MagnetarAI**.

My story isn't polished, but it's real. I grew up as the son of a Southern Baptist pastor, spent years running from God, and finally met Him face-to-face in a London hotel room in 2025 when I broke and cried out for help. That moment changed everything.

Now I'm using what He's given me — a systems-engineering mind, ADHD-fueled creativity, and years in tech — to build something that matters.

**MagnetarAI** is a faith-driven technology company dedicated to creating secure, offline AI tools that empower missions and ministries.

Our core platform, **ElohimOS**, helps the Church and field teams do more with less.
Our outreach arm, **MagnetarMission**, exists to love those the Church has too often rejected — the poor, the outcast, the wounded, the searching.

My mission is simple:
**Build technology that serves people, not power. Glorify God through innovation.**
